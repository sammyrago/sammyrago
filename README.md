### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science. Some of my projects (miniature search engine and nuggets video game) are private because they contain code to projects that are still being taught in classes, but I am happy to add you as a collaborator if you would like to check it out!
